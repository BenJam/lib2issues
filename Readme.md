# [Lib2Issues](https://libraries.io/github/librariesio/lib2issues)

Sinatra app for creating GitHub issues whenever a new version of a dependency is discovered by [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) using the repository web hook feature.

## Development

Source hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/librariesio/lib2issues).
Report issues/feature requests on [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/librariesio/lib2issues/issues). Follow us on Twitter [@librariesio](https://twitter.com/librariesio). We also hangout on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/librariesio).

### Getting Started

New to Ruby? No worries! You can follow these instructions to install a local server, or you can use the included Vagrant setup.

#### Installing a Local Server

First things first, you'll need to install Ruby 2.2.3. I recommend using the excellent [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv),
and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)

```bash
rbenv install 2.2.3
rbenv global 2.2.3
```

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
   future version unintentionally.
 * Add documentation if necessary.
 * Commit, do not change procfile, version, or history.
 * Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
